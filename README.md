# HarvestMoon 1.0 - master branch (pre-pre-pre-alpha of UWP)

![Logo](Images/logo.png)

Planned Xbox One's HarvestMoon "remake" (UWP).

## Preface

" This game was the start of a harvest moon clone using XNA. Both me and my fiance love harvest moon and we wanted to
take it further to include trapping and hunting etc. " - Steve Anderson (Mar, 23 2013)

## Status
- Slow porting to UWP
- Only Map Editor reconstructed at now
- Game runs but game content is not all / full (i.e., no some "containers"?...)
- To be continued... I hope :)
